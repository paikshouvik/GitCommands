How to create a new project in git and add files/updates to the remote repository?

Start with creating a new project
Try to avoid changing the main branch at all costs. Use this procedure, 
             (i)  Create a new branch remotely before updating the main branch
             (ii) clone the remote project locally
             (iii) Add or update the change in the newly created branch
             (iv) Stage the changes 
             (v) Commit these changes with a message
             (vi) push to the remote repository  
             (vii) marge the new branch to the main branch and delete the created branch

Step 1: 
go to the remote repository using a browser and create a new project.

Step 2: 
Open the cmd prompt and go to the desired directory 
cd C:\dev\Desired_Directory
Now, clone the project you want to update. execute the below command
git clone <url>
Example
git clone https://github.com/paikshouvik/GitCommands.git
This will create a folder named "GitCommands" inside your desired directory 

git fetch origin <branch name>
git fetch origin dev

git switch <branch name>
git switch dev

# this displays the state of the working directory and the staging area
git status 
Step 3: 
Update or add the changes using a code editor or text editor or by creating a new file inside the cloned directory.
For example, go to the folder "GitCommands" for the above-cloned project. Add a new file or update the files. 

Step 4:
To stage the changes,
#To stage all changes at once 
git add . 
or
git add -A
or 
git add <file name>

Step 5:
Commit the changes
git commit -m "commit message"

Step 6:
push to git remote branch
git push origin <branch name>


Step 7:
let's say we want to merge into the master branch 
git checkout master
git pull origin master 
git merge <branch name>
git push origin master
